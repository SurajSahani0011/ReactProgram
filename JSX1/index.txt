JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It looks similar to XML/HTML but ultimately gets transpiled to JavaScript. JSX allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax that resembles XML or HTML, making it easier to visualize and understand the structure of your UI.

Here's a basic example of JSX in a React component:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>
      <p>This is a JSX example in React.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
In this example, the code inside the return statement looks similar to HTML, but it's JSX. React components can be expressed using this syntax, and behind the scenes, tools like Babel transpile JSX into regular JavaScript that the browser can understand.

Here's how the above JSX might look after transpilation:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return React.createElement('div', null,
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, JSX!'),
    React.createElement('p', null, 'This is a JSX example in React.')
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
However, using JSX is generally more readable and easier to write compared to the equivalent code using React.createElement.

Keep in mind that JSX is not required to build React applications, but it is a popular and convenient choice for many developers. Under the hood, React components are ultimately JavaScript functions, and JSX is just a more expressive way to define them.
